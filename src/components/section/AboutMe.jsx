      <p>About Me

      Hello, I'm Harshit Rajput, a passionate and results-driven Full Stack Developer based in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. With a background in computer science and a graduation year of 2020, my journey into the world of technology has been both unconventional and rewarding.
      
      I started by venturing into the entrepreneurial realm, establishing and managing my own school catering to students from KG1 to 9. This experience not only honed my business acumen but also fueled my interest in graphic design, a skill I've cultivated over the years.
      
      The turning point came when I discovered web development during my exploration of graphic design. Intrigued by its creative aspects, I dedicated the past 8 months to mastering various technologies. This journey led me to Function Up, where I delved into the MERN stack, MySQL, Git, Docker, React.js, Next.js, and Material-UI.
      
      I thrive on challenges and am deeply committed to continuous learning. My unique blend of business experience, creative design background, and newfound expertise in web development positions me as a well-rounded professional. I'm now eager to apply my skills and passion to contribute to the ever-evolving field of IT.
      
      Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to exploring how I can bring value to your projects.</p>
